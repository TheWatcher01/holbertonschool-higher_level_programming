# Higher-level programming - Python, SQL

This repository contains my work and projects as a Software Engineering student at Holberton School Toulouse. The main focus of these projects is to gain a deep understanding of Python and SQL, two powerful tools in the field of software development.

The projects listed below cover a wide range of topics, from basic Python programming, data structures, object-oriented programming, to SQL queries and object-relational mapping. Each project is a step towards mastering these technologies and becoming a proficient software engineer.
